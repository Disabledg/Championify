<p>Championify is a little program that downloads all the recent builds from Champion.gg and imports them in to your League of Legends to use within game! No hassle. Now with customization settings and a GUI!</p>

<p>Windows and OSX are both supported, tested on Windows 8.1 and OSX 10.10.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2W3rKzK.png" alt="screenshot"></p>

<p>Check out some more screenshots <a href="https://imgur.com/2W3rKzK,ADYZ9ED,KNVRFs7,umDkx5j,scpQPBH,GpHtwKt#0">here</a>!</p>

<p>Note this application is still in development, as far as I've tested it's worked great, but don't get overly surprised if you find a bug or two.</p>

<p>This application is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ebildude123/champion.gg-item-set-creator">ebildude123</a> item set creator done in PHP.</p>

<h4>
<a id="rules" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Must pass all tests. <code>npm test</code>
</li>
<li>Must write tests for all new functions (look at current tests for examples, still a WIP).</li>
<li>Functions must be camel cased. <code>downloadStuff()</code>
</li>
<li>Variables must be underscored. <code>my_champion = 'teemo'</code>
</li>
<li>PR must be off and back to master branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest making sure your linters are setup correctly, or run gulp lint every now and again.</p>

<h4>
<a id="be-more-descriptive-what-does-this-actually-do" class="anchor" href="#be-more-descriptive-what-does-this-actually-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Be more descriptive, what does this actually do?</h4>

<p>Well it's easy really. Here's a link for <a href="http://champion.gg/champion/Teemo">Teemo's most popular build in top lane</a> that Champion.gg has tracked. We take this information and save it in a way that League of Legends likes so you can have the exact builds in game!</p>

<h4>
<a id="is-it-safe" class="anchor" href="#is-it-safe" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is it safe?</h4>

<p>Yep it's safe! Were not modifying League of Legends at all, so no rules broken there. And my code is clean and free to browse, so no smelly virus' or surprises. I've added VirusTotal report to all my recent releases just to be sure. If you still don't trust my executables, have a tech buddy look over my code themselves and you can build from <a href="#source">source</a>.</p>

<p>If you have version 0.2.0 or lower, that's my fault, sorry about that. I made a mistake with my Auto Updater that caused the issue. Redownload the latest version and this shouldn't happen again. Found <a href="https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/releases/latest">here</a>.</p>

<p>Run Championify.exe, the app will try and look for your League of Legends folder for you. If the app can't find it, browse to your League of Legends folder where lol.launcher.exe is saved (LoLLauncher.exe for Garena installations).</p>

<p>Run Championify, the app will try and look for your League of Legends.app for you. If the app can't find it, browse and select your League of Legends.app.</p>

<p>Due to Riot restrictions, you can only see the item sets in game, you won't see them in the launcher.</p>

<h4>

<p>Sorry, Electron doesn't support anything below 7 or Mountain Lion. There's no plans to support it.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/27/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-is-from-an-unidentified-developer/">this</a> to fix it.</p>

<p>Calm down, I gotcha! If something went wrong it means something has changed that I did not expect. Follow the steps <a href="#uninstall">below</a> in the next FAQ question to remove Championify's builds.</p>

<p><a name="uninstall"></a></p>

<h4>
<a id="nah-bro-i-dont-like-this-how-can-i-delete-all-your-builds" class="anchor" href="#nah-bro-i-dont-like-this-how-can-i-delete-all-your-builds" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nah bro, I don't like this. How can I delete all your builds?</h4>

<p>I'm sorry you don't like it, hopefully I'll have it live up to your expectations one day! As for deleting, just hit the "Delete" button in Championify and it'll remove all the items sets generated by Championify.</p>

<h4>
<a id="should-i-be-running-this-everyday" class="anchor" href="#should-i-be-running-this-everyday" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Should I be running this everyday?</h4>

<p>Oh no not at all, that's the last thing you want to do. The best time to run Championify is 3-4 day after a major patch comes out. Only got to do it once.</p>

<h4>
<a id="why-do-you-force-auto-updates" class="anchor" href="#why-do-you-force-auto-updates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why do you force auto updates?</h4>

<p>If something was to change on Riots end and Championify's item sets broke your client or completely screwed up one of your games, you'd be pretty pissed right? I know I would be. This is just one method to make sure you run in to the least amount of problems possible, plus the update are under ~4MB anyway.</p>

<h4>
<a id="why-is-my-antivirus-complaining-about-lolflavor" class="anchor" href="#why-is-my-antivirus-complaining-about-lolflavor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is my antivirus complaining about lolflavor?</h4>

<p>Let me guess, BitDefender? I know, I got it running too. For some reason they have lolflavor marked as malware, which I've checked myself and it's not. To add, Championify never loads a lolflavor page, so even if there was malware laying around Championify would never open it. See <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/url/576b112b6ae43a58f00176c5efe8f9456fa16dcfcf4e341e17f6c68c6a5e0e88/analysis/1435015572/">virus total report here</a>. To fix the issue, add "lolflavor.com" to your exceptions in your anti virus.</p>

<a id="if-this-has-been-done-before-why-did-you-do-it-again" class="anchor" href="#if-this-has-been-done-before-why-did-you-do-it-again" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If this has been done before, why did you do it again?</h4>

<p>Well for a few reasons. <a href="https://github.com/ebildude123/champion.gg-item-set-creator">ebildude123</a> original script is in PHP, and I wanted to do some changes and I don't like PHP in the slightest. Another issue is that the greater part of the world doesn't have PHP installed by default making the use of his script very difficult, plus you have a good number of people who automatically run in fear when they have to open a command prompt. My solution is a simple .exe/.app where you run and follow the instructions. Much easier.</p>

<h4>
<a id="why-is-your-script-so-slow" class="anchor" href="#why-is-your-script-so-slow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is your script so slow?</h4>

<p>Well damn, you must be pretty impatient if you think that's slow... The script is slowed on purpose so users don't spam Champion.gg's servers. They're doing great great stuff over there and the last thing I'd want to do is cause them trouble. However if it's REALLY slow, then you should consider upgrading your dial up connection.</p>

<h4>
<a id="why-is-the-file-size-so-big" class="anchor" href="#why-is-the-file-size-so-big" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is the file size so big?</h4>

<p>I use Electron to wrap my GUI, and unfortunately it's a bit big. I'd rather the App just work then worry about size.</p>

<h2>
<a id="build-from-source" class="anchor" href="#build-from-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build From Source</h2>

<p>You must have iojs 2.3.1 installed on your system (thats what Electron is using), git clone the repo and run the following in the root folder.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre><span class="pl-mo">npm install -g gulp</span>
<span class="pl-mo">npm install</span>
<span class="pl-mo">npm run build</span></pre></div>

<p>You'll find a Championify.exe/Championify.app in the releases folder.</p>

<p>Wine is required if building on Mac for Windows.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre><span class="pl-mo">brew install wine</span></pre></div>
